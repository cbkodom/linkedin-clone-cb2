LinkedIn Clone
This project is built with React/Redux. Firebase is used for the hosting and authentication. 
It will be built initially with the same functionalities as LinkedIn, and later modified to only connect to people from the same organization or affiliation to engage in various forms of discussions in order to either promote or improve their brand/interests.
